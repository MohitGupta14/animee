                            "That day, the human race remembered the terror of being dominated by
                            them, and the shame of being held captive in a birdcage..." — Over 100
                            years ago, a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans, giant
                            humanoid but mindless monsters whose sole purpose of existence seemed
                            to be to devour humans. There was an insurmountable gap in power
                            between them and mankind, and as a result, humanity was rapidly
                            exterminated to the brink of extinction. The survivors responded by
                            constructing three concentric walls: Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall
                            Sina, which graced them with a century of peace. However, one day a
                            Colossal Titan far larger than any other seen before breached the
                            outer wall, allowing the smaller Titans to invade the human territory
                            and forcing the survivors to retreat to the inner walls. Eren Jaeger,
                            a boy whose mother was eaten during the invasion, vowed to wipe every
                            last Titan off the face of the Earth, and joined the military
                            determined to exact his revenge.

                            High school student Light Yagami discovers a supernatural notebook that allows him to kill
                            anyone by
                            writing the victim's name while picturing their face. The story follows his attempts to

                            creating a New World cleansed of evil by using the notebook, and the complex conflict

                            Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second anime adaptation developed by Bones based on
                            the
                            Fullmetal Alchemist manga by Hiromu Arakawa and is directed by Yasuhiro Irie and written by
                            Hiroshi
                            Ōnogi. It was first announced in the manga series' 20th tankōbon volume.[1][2] The series
                            premiered on
                            April 5, 2009, on MBS-TBS' Sunday 5:00 pm JST anime time block, replacing Mobile Suit Gundam
                            00, and ran
                            weekly until airing its final episode on July 4, 2010. Voice actors Romi Park and Rie
                            Kugimiya reprised
                            their roles as main characters Edward and Alphonse Elric, respectively.[3] The series is
                            much more
                            similar to the manga, unlike the 2003 anime

                            People are not born equal, a realization that four-year-old Izuku Midoriya faced when
                            bullied by his
                            classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born
                            with
                            absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of
                            becoming a
                            great hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to
                            become, he will
                            now join the ranks of one of the highest rated "Hero Academies" in the country: U.A. High
                            School. With
                            the help of his idol All Might, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero?

                            Strange murders are happening in Tokyo. Due to liquid evidence at the scene, the police
                            conclude the
                            attacks are the results of 'eater' type ghouls. College buddies Kaneki and Hide come up with
                            the idea
                            that ghouls are imitating humans so that's why they haven't ever seen one. Little did they
                            know that
                            their theory may very well become reality.
