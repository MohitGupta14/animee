                            "That day, the human race remembered the terror of being dominated by
                            them, and the shame of being held captive in a birdcage..." — Over 100
                            years ago, a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans, giant
                            humanoid but mindless monsters whose sole purpose of existence seemed
                            to be to devour humans. There was an insurmountable gap in power
                            between them and mankind, and as a result, humanity was rapidly
                            exterminated to the brink of extinction. The survivors responded by
                            constructing three concentric walls: Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall
                            Sina, which graced them with a century of peace. However, one day a
                            Colossal Titan far larger than any other seen before breached the
                            outer wall, allowing the smaller Titans to invade the human territory
                            and forcing the survivors to retreat to the inner walls. Eren Jaeger,
                            a boy whose mother was eaten during the invasion, vowed to wipe every
                            last Titan off the face of the Earth, and joined the military
                            determined to exact his revenge.

                            High school student Light Yagami discovers a supernatural notebook that allows him to kill
                            anyone by
                            writing the victim's name while picturing their face. The story follows his attempts to
                            become a god by
                            creating a New World cleansed of evil by using the notebook, and the complex conflict
                            between himself
                            and all those who try to stop or help him.

                            Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second anime adaptation developed by Bones based on
                            the
                            Fullmetal Alchemist manga by Hiromu Arakawa and is directed by Yasuhiro Irie and written by
                            Hiroshi
                            Ōnogi. It was first announced in the manga series' 20th tankōbon volume.[1][2] The series
                            premiered on
                            April 5, 2009, on MBS-TBS' Sunday 5:00 pm JST anime time block, replacing Mobile Suit Gundam
                            00, and ran

                            much more

                            People are not born equal, a realization that four-year-old Izuku Midoriya faced when
                            bullied by his
                            classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born
                            with
                            absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of
                            becoming a
                            great hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to
                            become, he will
                            now join the ranks of one of the highest rated "Hero Academies" in the country: U.A. High
                            School. With
                            the help of his idol All Might, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero?

                            The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man made of rubber, whom, inspired by his
                            childhood idol, the powerful pirate "Red Haired" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East
                            Blue Sea to find the mythical treasure, the One Piece, and proclaim himself the King of the
                            Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 1] Luffy rescues
                            and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search
                            of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief
                            and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, a perverted but chivalrous
                            chef. They acquire a ship, the Going Merry,[Jp 2] and engage in confrontations with
                            notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures,
                            others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized
                            reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a
                            cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man helmsman
                            and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Once the Going Merry becomes damaged
                            beyond repair, the Straw Hat Pirates acquire a new ship, the Thousand Sunny,[Jp 3] built by
                            Franky. Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations,
                            revolutionaries, secret agents, and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various
                            other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.
