                                them, and the shame of being held captive in a birdcage..." — Over 100
                                years ago, a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans, giant
                                humanoid but mindless monsters whose sole purpose of existence seemed
                                to be to devour humans. There was an insurmountable gap in power
                                between them and mankind, and as a result, humanity was rapidly
                                exterminated to the brink of extinction. The survivors responded by
                                constructing three concentric walls: Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall
                                Sina, which graced them with a century of peace. However, one day a
                                Colossal Titan far larger than any other seen before breached the
                                outer wall, allowing the smaller Titans to invade the human territory
                                and forcing the survivors to retreat to the inner walls. Eren Jaeger,
                                a boy whose mother was eaten during the invasion, vowed to wipe every
                                last Titan off the face of the Earth, and joined the military
                                determined to exact his revenge.

                                village of Resembool in the country of Amestris. Their father Hohenheim, a noted and
                                very gifted alchemist, abandoned his family while the boys were still young, and while
                                in Trisha's care they began to show an affinity for alchemy and became curious about its
                                secrets. However, when Trisha died of a lingering illness, they were cared for by their
                                best friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako. The boys traveled the world to
                                advance their alchemic training under Izumi Curtis. Upon returning home, the two decide
                                to try to bring their mother back to life with alchemy. However, human transmutation is
                                a taboo, as it is impossible to do so properly. In the failed transmutation that results
                                in Al's body being completely obliterated, and Ed losing his left leg.

                                classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was
